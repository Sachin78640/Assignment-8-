The main difference between class-based components and function-based components in React lies in how they are defined and how they handle state and lifecycle methods.

Class-based components:

1. Definition: Class-based components are defined as ES6 classes that extend the `React.Component` class. They are declared using the `class` keyword and have a `render()` method that returns JSX to describe the component's UI.

2. State management: Class components have an internal state object, which allows them to hold and manage data that can change over time. State can be initialized in the `constructor()` method and updated using the `setState()` method. The component re-renders when the state is updated.

3. Lifecycle methods: Class components provide lifecycle methods, such as `componentDidMount()`, `componentDidUpdate()`, and `componentWillUnmount()`. These methods can be used to perform actions at specific points in the component's lifecycle, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or cleaning up resources.

4. 'this' keyword: In class components, the `this` keyword is used to refer to the component instance and access its properties and methods. Binding `this` is required in event handlers or when passing methods as callbacks.

Function-based components:

1. Definition: Function-based components are defined as JavaScript functions. They are declared using the function declaration or arrow function syntax. The function receives `props` as an argument and returns JSX to describe the component's UI.

2. State management: Function-based components were traditionally stateless, meaning they didn't have an internal state. However, with the introduction of React Hooks, function-based components can now use hooks like `useState()` to manage state within the component.

3. Lifecycle methods: Function-based components can use the `useEffect()` hook to replicate the behavior of lifecycle methods in class components. The `useEffect()` hook allows performing side effects, such as data fetching or subscriptions, based on the component's lifecycle.

4. Simplicity: Function-based components are generally simpler and more lightweight compared to class components. They have a more concise syntax and don't require a separate `render()` method. They are often easier to read, test, and reason about.

The introduction of React Hooks in React 16.8 has made function-based components more powerful and widely used. Hooks allow function-based components to handle state and lifecycle behaviors previously only available in class components, providing a more functional programming approach to React development.

In general, if you need state or lifecycle methods in your component, or if you are working on a legacy codebase that uses class components, you may opt for class-based components. On the other hand, if you don't need state or lifecycle methods and prefer a simpler syntax, function-based components with hooks are recommended
